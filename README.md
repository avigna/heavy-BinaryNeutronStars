# heavy-BinaryNeutronStars
## Fallback supernova of an exploding stripped star with a light neutron star companion

## Documentation
These scripts have been developed to plot the MESA, Gadget-2 and COMPAS results from Vigna-Gomez et al. 2021b ([arXiv:2106.12381](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12381))

More details of the structure of the repo and its contents will be added soon.

## Resources
The underlying data which is used and called in these scripts is publicly available via:
